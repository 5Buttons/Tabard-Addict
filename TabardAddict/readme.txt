* additional table optimizations

FAQ(s):
=======
(Q) Why show tabards not available to my character?
(*) Many people like to see what their horde character looks like in alliance tabards and vice versa in the Dressing Room.
(*) You can also see what your character looks like in TCG loot code tabards before buying a loot code.

(Q) I just equipped a new tabard but the addon did not update.
(*) The addon updates when the window is opened, so close and reopen the addon window.
